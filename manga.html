                    <p>First-year high school student Natsuo Ishido has always been a gifted athlete, and her 
                        ability to easily master every sport has not only bought her a life of boredom, but the 
                        resentment of everyone else who has had to work hard for their achievements. Not that 
                        Natsuo cares what anyone else thinks. All she longs for is a break from the monotony...
                        for a real challenge worthy of pouring all her efforts into. A rival - an equal-worth 
                        beating down and demoralizingâ€¦ That all seems like a pipe dream until a pair of annoyingly 
                        peppy transfer students arrive from Brazil and start up a brand-new club that teases the 
                        challenge she craves - Mixed Martial Arts.

                    <h2>Dragon Ball</h2>
                    <p>Dragon Ball introduces a young monkey-tailed boy named Goku (a wry update of the classic 
                        Chinese "Monkey King" legend), whose quiet life changes when he meets a girl named Bulma 
                        who is on a quest to collect seven "Dragon Balls." If she gathers them all, an incredibly 
                        powerful dragon will appear and grant her one wish. But the precious orbs are scattered 
                        all over the world, and Bulma could use the help of a certain super-strong boy... (In 
                        Japan, Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z were originally a single 42-volume series).
