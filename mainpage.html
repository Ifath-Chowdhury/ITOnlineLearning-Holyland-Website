        <p id="orangeparagraph">Holyland is a manga about a young student who wanders the gang-ridden streets of Japan because he feels like he has no place at home or school. This story is not just filled with detailed action, but also with beautiful character writing as well as interesting insight from the author's own experiences!</p>
